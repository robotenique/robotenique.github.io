      <description>Why study inferential statistics? It&amp;rsquo;s very common to read news and articles with &amp;ldquo;studies have shown that X!&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;science proves that Y&amp;rdquo; in today&amp;rsquo;s age of information. Or even read scientific papers with some dubious affirmations when dealing with reporting results and drawing conclusions from experimental data. Statistical inference is one of those topics in which the basic concepts are very important to grasp to avoid any misconceptions when interpreting it.</description>

      <description>Last year I found out about a Gacha game called Saint Seiya Awakening, which I&amp;rsquo;ve tried to play for some time, but then gave up on it. However I still do watch people play it, people who usually have enough time to invest in the game (it demands quite an amount of your time to be at a competitive level). Gacha games are usually free-to-play, but it is full of loot boxes, roulettes, slot machines, microtransactions and everything else that makes the player want to buy stuff in-game.</description>
