      <description>Bézier Curves I recently started toying with Processing and generative art, and in this little journey I&amp;rsquo;ve come across a specific method for curve drawing called the Bézier Curve. It is a parametric curve that is widely used in computer graphics, almost everywhere you need to draw curves: digital typography, vector graphics, illustration software (Adobe Illustrator, Inkscape), animation, etc.
This curve has a very interesting mathematical definition (it also has a recursive definition) and can be defined for any degree n.</description>

When thinking about the concept itself, it&amp;rsquo;s necessary to understand — in a semiotic sense — what Baudrillard defines as simulation and simulacra. To not delve deep into these subjects here (you can find more in this book), these concepts manifest themselves in postmodern societies with increasingly meta references, for everything.</description>
