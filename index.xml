      <description>Hi, I am Juliano Garcia, a Computer Scientist from IME-USP at the University of São Paulo, and this is my personal blog. In 2019 I graduated in Computer Science with an specialization in Artificial Intelligence, focusing my studies in statistics, algorithms, machine learning and related areas in AI such as game theory, classical planning, knowledge-based systems, etc.
I currently work as a Data Scientist using state-of-the-art data science to empower people in their finantial lives at Nubank&amp;rsquo;s Credit team, in São Paulo/Brazil.</description>

      <title>A Study on Gradient Boosting Classifiers</title>
      <link>https://robotenique.github.io/portfolio/tcc/</link>

      <description>Gradient Boosting Machines (GBMs) is a supervised machine learning algorithm that has been achieving state-of-the-art results in a wide range of different problems and winning machine learning competitions. When building any machine learning model, the hyperparameter optimization can become a costly and time-consuming task depending on the number and the hyperparameter space of the tuning procedure. Machine learning users that are not experienced researchers or data science professionals can struggle to define which hyperparameters and values to choose when starting the model tuning, especially with newer GBMs implementations like the XGBoost and LightGBM library.</description>

      <title>Generating grid/image points in Python</title>

      <description>I was doing some assignment about the Percolation Problem, where given a graph, find if the top of the graph is connected to the bottom. There was some test files included, but I wanted to create my own images.
The input file of my assignment has, in the first line, the dimensions of the image. The images are always in a square ratio, n x n &amp;ldquo;pixels&amp;rdquo;. The remaining lines of the file contains pairs (a b) of the coordinates in the grid n x n.</description>

      <title>Atom &amp; Latex</title>

      <description>LaTeX is a DSL (domain specific language) that provides powerful typesetting tools. You can write complex mathematical expressions and much more, for example, the following characteristic polynomial expression was rendered using LaTeX (MathJax):
$$ \chi(\lambda) = \left| \begin{array}{ccc} \lambda - a &amp;amp; -b &amp;amp; -c \\\
-d &amp;amp; \lambda - e &amp;amp; -f \\\
-g &amp;amp; -h &amp;amp; \lambda - i \end{array} \right| $$
There are amazing online software to work with LaTeX such as ShareLaTeX or Overleaf, but sometimes you don&amp;rsquo;t have access to the internet, or want to have a compact environment to do most of your job.</description>

      <description>Have you ever heard of Atom? Atom is a text editor, similar to Sublime Text, but with a lot of different features, and much more flexibility and freedom. It&amp;rsquo;s described as A hackable text editor for the 21st century, because it&amp;rsquo;s very easy to create and change many of the settings available, and there&amp;rsquo;s a lot!
Atom is my personal editor, I prefer using it than the proprietary (but relatively good) Sublime Text, and other MAINSTREAM editors like vi/vim or emacs.</description>

      <title>Debug C programs using gdb</title>

      <description>GDB(GNU Project Debugger) is, as the name implies, a debugger with a lot of features to make your life easy when programming in C. Using gdb helps to debug C programs in real execution time, i.e. you can put break points in the program to evaluate the value of variables, detect when something has gone wrong, and many other uses. Here I&amp;rsquo;ll cover the basics that I use to debug simple C programs.</description>

      <title>Fast and easy Python LAN server</title>

      <description>This is a very simple tip, but it&amp;rsquo;s very useful when you want others to access your files, or you want to transfer files easily. Just open the terminal, navigate to the folder you want to serve, and then type:
$ python -m SimpleHTTPServer The server will be created in the IP of your machine.
To find your IP, type
$ ifconfig -all or
$ ip a If you&amp;rsquo;re using Python 3.</description>

      <description>Hello! In this post, I&amp;rsquo;ll show how is the setup that I use, the most common applications I mostly use when programming, some useful plugins, anyway, my complete programming environment. I&amp;rsquo;ll first cover my OS setup, then the applications and finally the customizations. Feel free to contact me if there&amp;rsquo;s any doubt, but I&amp;rsquo;ll try to be clear and concise.
DISCLAIMER: You do everything in your &amp;gt;OWN&amp;lt; risk! :D
 The setup I use a dualboot with debian and Windows 10.</description>

      <title>Law of Large Numbers Simulator</title>

      <description>This is a project to demonstrate in graph plotting and real data, Weak Law of Large numbers, which is a very useful Theorem used in statistics. As our website says: &amp;quot; In practice, it (the Weak Law of Large Numbers) dictates that, if repeated enough times, the accumulate results of the same experiment will tend to its real mathematical probabilities.&amp;rdquo;
The website plots in real time the graph of throwing a dice or a coin the number of times the user specifies, so it&amp;rsquo;s completely interactive, and the user have fully control over the start number, the amount of throws to perform, and even the speed of the plot.</description>
