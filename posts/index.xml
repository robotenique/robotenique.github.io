      <description>This post is based on an article I wrote some time ago; There may be some inconsistencies with the references, sorry.
Reccomender Systems In a world where digital information is increasing every year, recommender systems are very important tools to handle the challenge of information overload. A recommender system is a type of information filtering system with the ability to filter information from a large amount of data generated dynamically, according to a given preference, observed behavior or interest from the user [1].</description>

      <title>Hyperreality meets Utopian Virtual</title>

      <description>More real than reality In postmodern semiotics Baudrillard coined the term hyperreality, basically a state/characteristic of something unable to be distinguished from reality. When thinking about the concept itself, it&amp;rsquo;s necessary to understand — in a semiotic sense — what Baudrillard defines as simulation and simulacra. To not delve deep into these subjects here (you can find more in this book), these concepts manifest themselves in postmodern societies with increasingly meta references, for everything.</description>

      <title>Improving your statistical inferences</title>

      <description>Why study inferential statistics? It&amp;rsquo;s very common to read news and articles with &amp;ldquo;studies have shown that X!&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;science proves that Y&amp;rdquo; in today&amp;rsquo;s age of information. Or even read scientific papers with some dubious affirmations when dealing with reporting results and drawing conclusions from experimental data. Statistical inference is one of those topics in which the basic concepts are very important to grasp to avoid any misconceptions when interpreting it.</description>

      <description>Last year I found out about a Gacha game called Saint Seiya Awakening, which I&amp;rsquo;ve tried to play for some time, but then gave up on it. However I still do watch people play it, people who usually have enough time to invest in the game (it demands quite an amount of your time to be at a competitive level). Gacha games are usually free-to-play, but it is full of loot boxes, roulettes, slot machines, microtransactions and everything else that makes the player want to buy stuff in-game.</description>

      <description>I was doing some assignment about the Percolation Problem, where given a graph, find if the top of the graph is connected to the bottom. There was some test files included, but I wanted to create my own images.
The input file of my assignment has, in the first line, the dimensions of the image. The images are always in a square ratio, n x n &amp;ldquo;pixels&amp;rdquo;. The remaining lines of the file contains pairs (a b) of the coordinates in the grid n x n.</description>

      <description>LaTeX is a DSL (domain specific language) that provides powerful typesetting tools. You can write complex mathematical expressions and much more, for example, the following characteristic polynomial expression was rendered using LaTeX (MathJax):
$$ \chi(\lambda) = \left| \begin{array}{ccc} \lambda - a &amp;amp; -b &amp;amp; -c \\\
-d &amp;amp; \lambda - e &amp;amp; -f \\\
-g &amp;amp; -h &amp;amp; \lambda - i \end{array} \right| $$
There are amazing online software to work with LaTeX such as ShareLaTeX or Overleaf, but sometimes you don&amp;rsquo;t have access to the internet, or want to have a compact environment to do most of your job.</description>

      <description>Have you ever heard of Atom? Atom is a text editor, similar to Sublime Text, but with a lot of different features, and much more flexibility and freedom. It&amp;rsquo;s described as A hackable text editor for the 21st century, because it&amp;rsquo;s very easy to create and change many of the settings available, and there&amp;rsquo;s a lot!
Atom is my personal editor, I prefer using it than the proprietary (but relatively good) Sublime Text, and other MAINSTREAM editors like vi/vim or emacs.</description>

      <description>GDB(GNU Project Debugger) is, as the name implies, a debugger with a lot of features to make your life easy when programming in C. Using gdb helps to debug C programs in real execution time, i.e. you can put break points in the program to evaluate the value of variables, detect when something has gone wrong, and many other uses. Here I&amp;rsquo;ll cover the basics that I use to debug simple C programs.</description>

      <description>This is a very simple tip, but it&amp;rsquo;s very useful when you want others to access your files, or you want to transfer files easily. Just open the terminal, navigate to the folder you want to serve, and then type:
$ python -m SimpleHTTPServer The server will be created in the IP of your machine.
To find your IP, type
$ ifconfig -all or
$ ip a If you&amp;rsquo;re using Python 3.</description>

      <description>Hello! In this post, I&amp;rsquo;ll show how is the setup that I use, the most common applications I mostly use when programming, some useful plugins, anyway, my complete programming environment. I&amp;rsquo;ll first cover my OS setup, then the applications and finally the customizations. Feel free to contact me if there&amp;rsquo;s any doubt, but I&amp;rsquo;ll try to be clear and concise.
DISCLAIMER: You do everything in your &amp;gt;OWN&amp;lt; risk! :D
 The setup I use a dualboot with debian and Windows 10.</description>
