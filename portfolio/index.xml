      <title>A Study on Gradient Boosting Classifiers</title>

      <description>Gradient Boosting Machines (GBMs) is a supervised machine learning algorithm that has been achieving state-of-the-art results in a wide range of different problems and winning machine learning competitions. When building any machine learning model, the hyperparameter optimization can become a costly and time-consuming task depending on the number and the hyperparameter space of the tuning procedure. Machine learning users that are not experienced researchers or data science professionals can struggle to define which hyperparameters and values to choose when starting the model tuning, especially with newer GBMs implementations like the XGBoost and LightGBM library.</description>

      <title>Law of Large Numbers Simulator</title>

      <description>This is a project to demonstrate in graph plotting and real data, Weak Law of Large numbers, which is a very useful Theorem used in statistics. As our website says: &amp;quot; In practice, it (the Weak Law of Large Numbers) dictates that, if repeated enough times, the accumulate results of the same experiment will tend to its real mathematical probabilities.&amp;rdquo;
The website plots in real time the graph of throwing a dice or a coin the number of times the user specifies, so it&amp;rsquo;s completely interactive, and the user have fully control over the start number, the amount of throws to perform, and even the speed of the plot.</description>
